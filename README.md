# alarmSystem

This project is from during my bachelors studies and is a model of an alarmsystem, where swithces in a voltage divider network was read on the analogue inputs of the board.
A distance meter in form of an ultrasound is added, triggering an alarm if an object is within a certain range.
Corresponding leds were set to indicate which swithces/alarms were triggered. Events are logged in a file and communicated to user via terminal.
Multithreading apprach.
